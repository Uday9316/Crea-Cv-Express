In the contemporary job market, an effective resume serves as a crucial tool for
job seekers to present their skills and experiences to potential employers. To
address the need for a user-friendly and efficient resume creation platform, we
developed a web application utilizing modern technologies such as React,
Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Firebase backend services.
This report outlines the design and implementation process of our resume
builder website. The project aimed to provide users with a seamless experience
in crafting personalized resumes while ensuring scalability and robustness
through the integration of Firebase Firestore for backend functionalities.
The utilization of React facilitated the creation of a dynamic and interactive user
interface, allowing users to effortlessly navigate through the resume building
process. Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap were employed to ensure responsive design
and aesthetic appeal, enhancing the overall user experience across various
devices and screen sizes.
The Firebase backend served as a reliable storage solution, enabling real-time
data synchronization and secure storage of user-generated content. Additionally,
Firebase Authentication was implemented to manage user accounts and ensure
data privacy and security.
Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on optimizing
performance, enhancing usability, and adhering to best practices in web
development. User feedback and iterative testing played a crucial role in refining
the websiteâ€™s features and functionalities.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
